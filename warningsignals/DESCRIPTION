Description: NOW FORKED TO SEPERATE REPOSITORY Detection of early warning signals. Dependecies: *snowfall* : provides support for parallelization.  *NORMT3* provides erf function for analytic solutions to timedep OU model, used in sde_likelihood's analytic_V fn.  *limma* is for avereps function only.  *sde* should be used for faster likelihood calculations and simulation.  *odesolve* is required for calculating the moments of the time-dependent models.  *psych* provides skew and kurtosis.   
Depends: snowfall, NORMT3, sde, odesolve, psych, limma
