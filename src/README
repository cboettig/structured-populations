Population Dynamics Simulations
===============================


Source Files in Pop Dyn suite 
-----------------------------
tribolium.cpp -- Individual based beetle dynamics, exact age transitions.  Uses kde.cpp library, custom Gillespie library for birth/death only.  
kde.cpp -- kernel density estimators, with kde.h


beetles.c -- ELPA beetle dynamics by Gillespie simulation (exp. waiting times between stages)
gamma_beetles.c -- ELPA model with linear chain trick, so ELP stages have k substages, making waiting times between stages gamma distributed

crowley.c -- birth-death model, competition based birth for x indep process from death event for y.  
			$ dx/dt = b_x x (K-x-y) - d_x x + c_x x y $
			$ dy/dt = b_y y (K-x-y) - d_y y - c_y x y $
metapop.c --  birth-death model + transitions:
			$ dx/dt = b_x x (K-x-y) - d_x x + c x y $
			$ dy/dt = b_y y (K-x-y) - d_y y - c x y $
hastings.c -- equivalent to setting c_y = 0 in crowley model. (deprecated)


gillespie.c -- Gillespie library. Uses gillespie.h 



odeintegrators.c -- ODE integration library used by warning_signals
pars.c -- used by warning signals 
record.c -- recording rules for warning_signals
odeinterators.c -- ode integration library to solve ODEs, used by warning_signals
correlation.c -- Correlation function statistics, general library used by warning_signals



main.c -- collect the executable versions for different programs for C-level compile only.  ws, correlation, tribol, beetle, crow, meta, hast, gs.  





Warning Signals 
-----------------

A saddle-node bifurcation example, with substantial code for C-based calculation of the classic warning signals


Crowley model
-------------



warning_signals.c
odeintegrators.c

gillespie.c, gillespie.h

correlation.c
record.c, record.h -- class for recording warning signals
pars.c, pars.h -- class for warning signals parameters
main.c

tribolium.cpp
kde.cpp  -- C consistent
